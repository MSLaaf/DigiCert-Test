Code Challenge:


Create a command-line utility in C++ to simulate a fictional public library, offering the following features:

1. Display a list of all books in the library.

2. Enable Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD-like) operations on individual books.

For each execution of the utility, specify:

1. The desired function.

2. The necessary data to support that function.

You have the flexibility to store data either in a custom file format or utilize an existing utility like Redis. No restrictions on resource usage or third-party plugins; demonstrate your skills in application architecture, design, and maintainability.apt
